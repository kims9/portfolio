							<p>I was the little kid behind the cash register at the deli my parents ran. I could make a mean sandwich like nobody's business. But when customers weren't around I was drawing on yellow legal pads behind the counter. I was born in Seoul but from the age of two, grew up as a true Midwesterner. I had an insatiable appetite to create- from drawing to painting to posting animations onto YouTube. I won many gold key Scholastic Art awards but I didn't realize that my creativity could translate into the workforce until later. </p>
							<p>I began my educational career at the University of Michigan and then transferred to Oakton College, where I was able to more freely explore my interests, from photography, painting, and sculpture to 3D modeling, electrical engineering, and robotics. Now I am enjoying my time at Parsons School of Design at The New School studying Design & Technology with a focus in creative technology. I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Autodesk Maya, Blender, Microsoft Excel, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and physical computing.</p>
